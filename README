 Information about Ubuntu mirroring
 ----------------------------------

If it is information about Ubuntu mirroring you're looking for, resources are
available at the Ubuntu Wiki at this page:

 - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors
 - http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/mirror

 Listings of Ubuntu Mirrors
 --------------------------

Listings of Ubuntu mirrors are maintained on Launchpad. This is split into two
sections, one for archive mirrors (mirrors of archive.ubuntu.com):

 - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors

Mirrors of the official Ubuntu CD images server (releases.ubuntu.com)

 - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors

Should you wish to register your own Ubuntu mirror, please do so here:

 - https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+newmirror

 Scripts included
 ----------------

The following scripts come with the ubumirror package:

 + ubuarchive: sync packages from an Ubuntu archive mirror.
 + ubucdimage: sync CD images from an Ubuntu cdimage mirror (cdimage.ubuntu.com).
 + ubuports: sync packages from an Ubuntu ports mirror (ports.ubuntu.com).
 + uburelease: sync CD images from an Ubuntu releases mirror.

 Setting up an Ubuntu Mirror with ubumirror
 ------------------------------------------

Please ensure that you have read and understood the Mirror Guidelines on the
Ubuntu Wiki page listed above.

This package installs the scripts above to the /usr/bin/ directory, an example
configuration and crontab file are installed into
/usr/share/doc/ubumirror/examples/ .

These two files should be edited as you see fit. For the ubumirror.conf file,
please make sure, if possible, to use a local rsync mirror for your (or a
nearby) country, instead of using the main archive/releases mirrors. See above
for Ubuntu mirror listings.

The crontab provided may be installed into the /etc/cron.d/ directory. Please
comment out the scripts that you do not wish to use in this file.
